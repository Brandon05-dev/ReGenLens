## What's New

Your maps are now **real 3D** with the following features:

### ✨ 3D Features Enabled

1. **3D Terrain Elevation**
   - Real elevation data from Mapbox DEM (Digital Elevation Model)
   - Mountains, valleys, and terrain features are visible in 3D
   - Exaggeration factor: 1.5x for better visibility

2. **3D Buildings**
   - Buildings appear as 3D structures when zoomed in (zoom level 15+)
   - Realistic building heights based on actual data
   - Toggle on/off with the checkbox in the controls

3. **Atmospheric Sky Layer**
   - Realistic atmosphere rendering
   - Creates depth and immersion
   - Enhances the 3D perspective

4. **Fog Effect**
   - Distance fog for realistic depth perception
   - Horizon blending for smooth transitions

5. **Auto-Rotate Mode**
